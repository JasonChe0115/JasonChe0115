- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I did DTS(Discipleship Training School) in Kona, Hawaii, in 2019 4.4 ~ 6.23.
                   And I went to a Mission Trip(Helping local people, Praying, Evangelism, etc) with my teammates to Swaziland, in South-Africa, in 2019.6.24 ~ 8.25.
                   And I came back to Hawaii, shared what we learned, and finished Debriefing. 2019 8.26 ~ 9.18
                   And I spent a week in Seoul, Korea with my family, and went to SunshineCoast in Australia to study Bible. 2019 9.24 ~ 2020 1.31
                   And I came back to Seoul for break and continued Bible study 2020 4.4 ~ 7.2
                   Hope to finish the Bible study someday. And Wish to go back to Africa to help local people.
